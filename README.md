# Minimalist Europe Card Bus (MECB)

Europe Card Bus (ECB) is a Retro CPU Bus standard from the late 1970’s / early 1980’s.

The “Minimalist Europe Card Bus” (MECB), as I call it, is a Retro 8-bit CPU Bus based PCB design standard that I decided to define & document. The purpose of which is to provide a modular platform for me to re-experience the fun of experimenting with the different 8-bit CPU’s, and the various video and peripheral devices, that I grew up with in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s.

My goal is that of a robust and modular design platform which would allow me to create interchangeable boards, based on time proven reliable bus connectors and modern low-cost prototype PCB manufacturing.

i.e. A robust, flexible, and low cost way for me to re-create some of the early microprocessor circuits, that I’d originally built using Wire-Wrap methods back in the day.

As evident from the name, the Bus itself is based on a Minimalist implementation of the original Europe Card Bus (ECB) standard.

The included 'MECB_Template' folder contains a KiCAD v7 Template to enable fast-tracking new MECB board designs. 
This template also includes the standardised PLD for Address Decoding and is as illustrated in the standardised board mechanical specifications diagram below.

To utilise the template, simply copy the entire folder and it's contents into your KiCAD v7 'KICAD_USER_TEMPLATE_DIR' path folder (as defined under: Preferences -> Configure Paths...).
